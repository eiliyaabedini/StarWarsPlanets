Project Requirements
1. Core Features
   Create an Android app that fetches and displays a list of planets from the Star Wars API
   (https://swapi.dev/api/planets/), using the first page of results.
   The list should display the following details for each planet:
   - Name
   - Climate
   - Population
   
2. Detail View
   Add a detail view that is displayed when the user selects a planet from the list.
   The detail view should include the following information about the selected planet:
   - Name
   - Climate
   - Population
   - Diameter
   - Gravity
   - Terrain

3. Technical Considerations
   - Use Jetpack Compose for all user interfaces.
   - Use an architecture you’re comfortable with (e.g., MVVM, MVI, etc.).
   - Simple UI, we do not need to see a beautiful interface (we love wireframes ✨)
